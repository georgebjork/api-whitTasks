# api-whitTasks

This an API that will interact with the WhitTasks App. This API will be able to pull data from a database and return it in JSON format. This will allow WhitTasks, which is
built-in flutter/dart, to retrieve tasks from a database and display them.

At the current moment, it can pull just user data and task data via stored procedures. Eventually, this API will have a lot more functionality and be able to pull a lot more specific data. This API will be continually developed alongside the WhitTasks app.

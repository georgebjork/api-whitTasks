# api-whitTasks

This an API that will interact with the WhitTasks App. This API will be able to pull data from a database and return it in JSON format. This will allow WhitTasks, which is
built in flutter/dart, to retrive tasks from a database and display them.

At the current moment it is able to pull just user data and task data via stored procdures. Eventually this API will have a lot more functionality and be able to pull a lot 
more specific data. This API will be continually devolped alongside the WhitTasks app.
